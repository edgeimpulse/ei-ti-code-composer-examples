/* A minimized implementation based from the full Edge Impulse firmware
 * for the CC1352P LaunchPad. This minimal example shows only code required to run
 * inferencing in both bare metal and RTOS projects.
 *
 * This example is provided for documentation purposes, has minimal testing, and
 * may not include the latest optimizations utilized by the fully supported Edge
 * Impulse firmware. For reference, see ei_run_impulse.cpp on github:
 * https://github.com/edgeimpulse/firmware-ti-launchxl/blob/main/
